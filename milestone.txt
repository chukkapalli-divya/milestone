<h1><u>AIR POLUTION</u></h1>
<h4>Definition</h4><big>
<p>Air pollution is contamination of the indoor or outdoor environment by any chemical, physical or biological agent that modifies the natural characteristics of the atmosphere. Household combustion devices, motor vehicles, industrial facilities and forest fires are common sources of air pollution.</p>
<h3><big>Causes of Air Pollution</big></h3>
<p> * By definition, pollution refers to any matter that is "out of place". In other words, it is what happens when toxins, contaminants, and other harmful products are introduced into an environment, disrupting its normal patterns and functions.</p><p> * When it becomes to our atmosphere, pollution refers to the introduction of chemicals, particulates, and biological matter that can be harmful to humans, plants and animals, and cause damage to the natural environment.</p><p> * Whereas some causes of pollution are entirely natural – being the result of sudden changes in temperature, seasonal changes, or regular cycles – others are the result of human impact (i.e. anthropogenic, or man-made). More and more, the effects of air pollution on our planet, especially those that result from human activity, are of great concern to developers, planners and environmental organizations, given the long-term effect they can have.</P>

<p>By composition, Earth's atmosphere is made up of nitrogen gas (78%), oxygen gas (21%), and other trace gases (such as argon and carbon dioxide). This balance is essential to all life here on Earth, so the introduction of pollutants can have a profound and damaging effect. All told, pollution can take many forms, like carbon compounds such as carbon monoxide (CO) and carbon dioxide (CO²). sulfuric compounds like sulfur dioxide (SO²), methane, radioactive decay, or toxic chemicals.</P
<p>In addition, air pollution can be divided into Primary and Secondary types of pollutants. Whereas primary pollutants are caused by primary sources – i.e. the direct result of processes (such as industrial emissions or volcanic eruptions ) – secondary pollutants are the results of intermingling and reactions by primary pollutants (such as carbon emissions and water vapor, which creates smog).</p>

<h3><big>Prevention of Air Polution</big></h3>
<img src="prevent.png">
<p> * Some important measures that can be adopted by individuals to contribute towards the prevention of air pollution have been listed below.</p>
<p> * Usage of public transport and carpooling – by reducing the amount of fuel combusted for an individual’s transportation needs, he/she can lower the amount of pollutants being released into the atmosphere and cause less air pollution. Furthermore, these options are also economically efficient and can help save money as well.</p>
<p> * Switching off the lights when they’re not in use – the majority of our electricity is produced from the combustion of fossil fuels, which are a huge contributor towards air pollution. Therefore, conserving electricity is an effective way of preventing air pollution.</p>
<p> * Reusing and recycling products – By reusing products (that can be reused), the amount of energy that goes into manufacturing another one of those products is conserved. Furthermore, recycling of products is also more energy-efficient than the manufacture of new ones.</p>

<p> * Avoiding the burning of garbage and smoking – burning of garbage is a huge contributor to air pollution. Another contributor to air pollution is cigarette smoking. Avoiding these activities and spreading awareness of their negative consequences can be of great help in the prevention of air pollution.</p>
<p>Avoiding the use of firecrackers – firecrackers are generally used to celebrate certain occasions. However, they are known to cause severe air pollution and are, therefore, extremely harmful to the environment. Personally avoiding the use of firecrackers and spreading awareness about their negative consequences is a great way to help prevent air pollution.</p>
